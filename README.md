# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, solved using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is solved in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

- `Day 01`: [Link to Day 01 Notebook]
- `Day 02`: [Link to Day 02 Notebook]
- ...
- `Day 25`: [Link to Day 25 Notebook]

To run the solutions, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
