# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, solved using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is solved in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

- `Day 01`: [Link to Day 01 Notebook](day_1/day1.ipynb)
- `Day 02`: [Link to Day 02 Notebook](day_2/day2.ipynb)
- `Day 03`: [Link to Day 03 Notebook](day_3/day3.ipynb)
- `Day 04`: [Link to Day 04 Notebook](day_4/day4.ipynb)
- `Day 05`: [Link to Day 05 Notebook](day_5/day5.ipynb)
- `Day 06`: [Link to Day 06 Notebook](day_6/day6.ipynb)
- `Day 07`: [Link to Day 07 Notebook](day_7/day7.ipynb)
- `Day 08`: [Link to Day 08 Notebook](day_8/day8.ipynb)

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
