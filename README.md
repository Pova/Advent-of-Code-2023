# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, solved using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is solved in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

- `Day 01`: [Link to Day 01 Notebook](day_01/day1.ipynb)
- `Day 02`: [Link to Day 02 Notebook](day_02/day2.ipynb)
- `Day 03`: [Link to Day 03 Notebook](day_03/day3.ipynb)
- `Day 04`: [Link to Day 04 Notebook](day_04/day4.ipynb)
- `Day 05`: [Link to Day 05 Notebook](day_05/day5.ipynb)
- `Day 06`: [Link to Day 06 Notebook](day_06/day6.ipynb)
- `Day 07`: [Link to Day 07 Notebook](day_07/day7.ipynb)
- `Day 08`: [Link to Day 08 Notebook](day_08/day8.ipynb)
- `Day 09`: [Link to Day 09 Notebook](day_09/day9.ipynb)
- `Day 10`: [Link to Day 10 Notebook](day_10/day10.ipynb)
- `Day 11`: [Link to Day 11 Notebook](day_11/day11.ipynb)
- `Day 12`: [Link to Day 12 Notebook](day_12/day12.ipynb)

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
